*Totango Command Line Utilities*

The Totango command line utilities are a set of scripts designed for simple access to Totango Data from the command-line. You can use it to export data from
your Totango account without learning the intricacies of the Totango API. Simply run the relevant script and grab the results from stdout.

Right now the toolchest is pretty minimal, so feel free to fork and add more tools to the mix.

*General*
General command-line arguments:
- apikey <API-TOKEN> see: https://app.totango.com/app.html#!/updateProfile?tab=Profile on how to find your token

output goes to stdout, with errors or progress printouts to stderr, so it's usually safe to redirect sdtout to a .csv file.
